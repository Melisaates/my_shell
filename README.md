# Shell Program

This shell program provides an environment for the user to execute commands. When the user runs the program, they enter commands, and the program processes these commands.

## Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Download or copy the C file that contains the `main` function.
2. Compile the file using your C compiler (e.g., GCC). For example, on Linux using GCC, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc shell.c -o shell


3. Run the compiled program:

./shell

    When the program starts, you will see a >> prompt representing a shell interaction. Here, you can enter your commands.

    Enter the command you want to run. You can use standard shell commands like ls, cd, pwd, etc.

    After entering the command you want to run, you will see the outputs and any error messages.

    After entering all the commands you want to run, you can exit the program by typing quit.

Example usage:
ls
file.txt program.c shell.c
pwd
/home/kullanici/proje
quit
bye bye
